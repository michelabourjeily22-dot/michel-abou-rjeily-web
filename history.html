            <p>The World Wide Web was born in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist working at CERN, proposed a system for sharing information across different computers. His vision was to create a universal linked information system that would allow researchers to easily share and access documents.</p>

                <h2>The Browser Wars (1994-2001)</h2>
                
                <p>The mid-1990s saw the emergence of commercial web browsers and the beginning of what became known as the "Browser Wars." Netscape Navigator, released in 1994, quickly became the dominant browser, but Microsoft's Internet Explorer, bundled with Windows, eventually gained market supremacy.</p>

                <h3>Key Developments During the Browser Wars</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>1994:</strong> Netscape Navigator 1.0 released, introducing many web features</li>
                    <li><strong>1995:</strong> Internet Explorer 1.0 released by Microsoft</li>
                    <li><strong>1996:</strong> JavaScript introduced by Netscape, revolutionizing web interactivity</li>
                    <li><strong>1997:</strong> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) becomes a W3C recommendation</li>
                    <li><strong>2001:</strong> Internet Explorer reaches 95% market share</li>

                <h2>The Rise of Web Standards (2001-2008)</h2>
                
                <p>As the web matured, the need for consistent standards became apparent. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) played a crucial role in developing and promoting web standards. This period also saw the emergence of new browsers that would challenge Internet Explorer's dominance.</p>

                <h3>Mozilla Firefox and the Open Source Movement</h3>
                <p>In 2004, Mozilla Firefox was released, built on the open-source Gecko engine. Firefox introduced features like tabbed browsing, pop-up blocking, and better security, quickly gaining popularity among web developers and users.</p>
