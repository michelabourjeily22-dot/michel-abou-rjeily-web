                <h2>Introduction to Web Security</h2>
            </header>
            
            <p>In today's digital age, web security has become paramount as our personal, financial, and professional lives increasingly depend on internet-connected systems. Cyber threats are evolving rapidly, with attackers using sophisticated techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications, networks, and user behavior.</p>

            <p>The cost of cybercrime continues to rise, with global damages estimated to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Understanding web security is not just important for IT professionalsâ€”it's essential for anyone who uses the internet.</p>

                <p>The current OWASP Top 10 includes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Broken Access Control:</strong> Improper restrictions on authenticated users</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryptographic Failures:</strong> Weak or missing encryption</li>
                    <li><strong>Injection:</strong> SQL, NoSQL, and command injection vulnerabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Insecure Design:</strong> Missing or ineffective security controls</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Misconfiguration:</strong> Insecure default configurations</li>

                <h2>Essential Security Practices</h2>
                
                <h3>Encryption and Data Protection</h3>
                <p>Encryption is the foundation of data protection, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure even if intercepted by unauthorized parties. Modern web security relies on several encryption technologies.</p>

                <h4>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</h4>
                <p>TLS, the successor to SSL, provides encrypted communication between web browsers and servers. TLS 1.3, the current standard, offers improved security and performance compared to earlier versions.</p>

                <h3>Secure Authentication Methods</h3>
                <p>Strong authentication is crucial for protecting user accounts and sensitive systems. Modern authentication systems often employ multiple factors to verify user identity.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Requires multiple verification methods</li>
                    <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Uses unique biological characteristics</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Security Keys:</strong> Physical devices for authentication</li>
                    <li><strong>Password Managers:</strong> Tools for generating and storing strong passwords</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Secure Coding Practices</h2>
                
                <h3>Input Validation and Sanitization</h3>
                <p>All user input should be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks. This includes checking data types, length limits, and format requirements before processing.</p>

                <h3>Error Handling and Information Disclosure</h3>
                <p>Proper error handling prevents sensitive information from being exposed to attackers. Error messages should be generic and not reveal system internals.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Best Practices for Users</h2>
                
                <h3>Password Security</h3>
                <p>Users should create strong, unique passwords for each account and use password managers to store them securely. Regular password changes are recommended, especially after security incidents.</p>

                <h3>Safe Browsing Habits</h3>
                <p>Users should be cautious when clicking links, downloading files, and entering personal information online. Verifying website authenticity and using secure connections (HTTPS) are essential practices.</p>
